**Beginning of December: Implement time-locked staking contracts called “Sands of Time Vaults.”**
We will begin acquiring liquidity before the Conductor launch by giving away another big chunk of the DEA supply currently inside of other staking contracts. The specific number will be decided upon one week before we launch the Vaults.

We will also create an "APY guesstimation sheet" based on some number crunching, to give users a perspective of what is to come.

**Around New Year’s Eve: Launch Conductor market maker.**
From there on, users will be able to buy and sell TSLA and QQQ, as well as inverted TSLA and inverted QQQ.

**End of February: Add the S&P 500 data feed from finnhub.io to Conductor.**
We plan to have around 500² different possible asset combinations on DEUS Swap.
Because every asset can be combined with another asset, 250,000 different asset combinations on DEUS Swap will be available next year.

**Mid-March: Rebalancing development begins.** 
Learn more about rebalancing in [this medium article](https://lafayettetabor.medium.com/dea-discovering-her-true-powers-6d1cd311baef).

**June: Acquiring security audits by respected brands.**
All contracts used will be audited.
