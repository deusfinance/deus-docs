## Major Suggestions
This website is built using the [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) framework, which is a modern static website generator. For any additional guidance to get the maximum out of the framework, please visit their website. Anyhow, the below contents should provide all sufficient information needed.

#### Prerequisites
+ You have to be on Node >= 8.x.

#### Getting Started
Clone this repo, and then run `npm install` to install all dependencies. Populate and rename `.sample.env` with Argola keys if you are interested in working with the search engine, else you can skip this step.

#### Run the software
Run `npm run start`. This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### How do I add a subpage?
Use any of the .md files within the `~root/docs` section as an example/blueprint for your own page. Once you are ready edit the `~root/sidebars.js` file and add the subpage reference there. That's it.

---

### How do I create custom pages outside of /docs?
Duplicate the `~root/src/pages/index.js` file and place it in the same directory, rename it however you like. That's it. Done! Your page is immediately accessible at `http://localhost:3000/your_page`. For this basic knowledge of React.js is required.
